Quick-start guide to get an stand-alone(independent) library
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. clone the repo

2. generate the makefiles / VS solution using cmake. A few options here, depending on

   (a) do you want to build open62541-compat as a shared or static library?

   (b) open62541-compat requires the boost library, do you want to use the system boost library or do you have a custom boost build?

   (c) open62541-compat depends on the quasar module LogIt, should the compat module clone, build and link LogIt source directly into
       the compat library or should the compat library consume LogIt from some external build.

   Time for an example...

### Linux examples
   - Build open62541-compat as a static library on linux. Use whatever the system installation of boost-devel is and build LogIt
     directly into the compat library
     ```
     cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_standard_install_cc7.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON
     ```

   - Build open62541-compat as a **shared** library on linux (and boost/LogIt treated as above) - just add **STANDALONE_BUILD_SHARED**
     ```
     cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_standard_install_cc7.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON -DSTANDALONE_BUILD_SHARED=ON
     ```

   - Build open62541-compat as a shared library on linux but with the LogIt library pulled in from some external build location (here LogIt is consumed as a shared library from /tmp/LogIt/). Note the **-DLOGIT** options define how LogIt is built into open62541-compat.
     ```
     cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_standard_install_cc7.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON -DSTANDALONE_BUILD_SHARED=ON -DLOGIT_BUILD_OPTION=LOGIT_AS_EXT_SHARED -DLOGIT_EXT_LIB_DIR=/tmp/LogIt/ -DLOGIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/LogIt/include/
     ```
### Windows examples (using a mingw 'git bash' command prompt)
   - Build open62541-compat as a static library on windows (visual studio 2017). Use a custom boost build (perhaps you built boost
     yourself, or have several boost installations available to choose from). Build LogIt directly into the compat library.
     ```
     # (comment) - set environment variables to point to the custom boost headers/libs directories (required by the toolchain file)
     export BOOST_PATH_HEADERS=/c/3rdPartySoftware/boost_mapped_namespace_builder/work/MAPPED_NAMESPACE_INSTALL/include/
     export BOOST_PATH_LIBS=/c/3rdPartySoftware/boost_mapped_namespace_builder/work/MAPPED_NAMESPACE_INSTALL/lib/

     cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_custom_win_VS2017.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
     ```
     Note! Your boost build/installation may be more exotic than ours, take a look at the sample custom toolchain file (__boost_custom_win_VS2017.cmake__)
     for inspiration, write your own and use it in your build via the build option **OPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE**

   - Build open62541-compat as a shared library on windows (visual studio 2017). Use a custom boost build. Use the LogIt library (here as a shared library) from some external build (as with the linux build above, the **-DLOGIT** options define how LogIt is built into open62541-compat).
     ```
     # (comment) - set environment variables to point to the custom boost headers/libs directories (required by the toolchain file)
     export BOOST_PATH_HEADERS=/c/3rdPartySoftware/boost_mapped_namespace_builder/work/MAPPED_NAMESPACE_INSTALL/include/
     export BOOST_PATH_LIBS=/c/3rdPartySoftware/boost_mapped_namespace_builder/work/MAPPED_NAMESPACE_INSTALL/lib/

     cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_custom_win_VS2017.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON -DSTANDALONE_BUILD_SHARED=ON -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLOGIT_BUILD_OPTION=LOGIT_AS_EXT_SHARED -DLOGIT_EXT_LIB_DIR=/c/workspace/OPC-UA/LogIt/Release/ -DLOGIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/c/workspace/OPC-UA/LogIt/include/
     ```

### Unit tests
Writing unit tests (and running unit tests) is a good habit; developers - if you're adding new features we recommend adding tests to really lock that work in place. Passing tests signify that features work now and provide an invaluable tool for future developers; to help them avoid inadvertently broken existing functionality. So, be a conscientious developer, write tests and run tests. By default (for stand-alone open62541-compat builds) unit tests are part of the build, if you need to skip them you can (but why would you?), more on skipping tests later. The open62541-compat module unit tests are based on the [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework. Note that the unit tests build to a stand-alone executable, this executable links to the stand-alone open62541-compat library as used in end-user applications - building the unit tests has ZERO effect on the actual end-user library binary that the build outputs.
* Unit tests and their requirements (basically googletest) are in the test subdirectory.
* New unit tests should be added to test/src (for help on writing tests see the googletest documentation, you might find inspiration in the existing tests too).
* From a clean start, the googletest framework is built from source (cloned from [here](https://github.com/google/googletest)), so it should execute on your platform.
* On running make for the open62541-compat module, the unit tests build to this executable: __test/open62541-compat-Test__. Note that executable is built after the open62541-compat library is built.
* Run those tests by simply invoking that executable:
```
./test/open62541-compat-Test
```

#### Skipping tests
If, for some reason, you feel you must omit unit tests from the build then there is a way, just add __-DSKIP_TESTS=ON__ to your cmake invocation command line. Taking the example of the stand-alone static library build on linux above the command line would be
```
cmake -DOPEN62541-COMPAT_BUILD_CONFIG_FILE=boost_standard_install_cc7.cmake -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON -DSKIP_TESTS=ON
```
(and feel guilty.)

###### How do you use it in your independent UASDK server or client? ######

The include directory contains UASDK-(partially)-compatible headers, and you should link with the following libs:
* build/libopen62541-compat.a
* open62541/build/libopen62541.a
